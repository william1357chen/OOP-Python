# Constructors in Python 

```python 
def __init__(self)
```
## Difference between Example and Example()
Let's say we have a class called Example
```python 
class Example:
    def __init__(self):
        self.example = None     
```
What is the difference between 
```python 
ex1 = Example
ex2 = Example()
```
classes are first-class objects, meaning you can return them, pass as parameter, assign to a variable, etc. `ex1` is simply the variable holding the class `Example`. `ex2` on the other hand, is a class instance. 
```python 
print(ex1) # This is a class
print(ex2) # This is a class instance
```
### Output 
```python
<class '__main__.Example'>
<__main__.Example object at 0x0000023B4B2D2FA0>
```
Now if I run 
```python
>>> print(ex1())
<__main__.Example object at 0x0000020814742EE0>
```
`ex1()` works like `Example()` which creates a class instance.
## Default Constructor in Python 
Simply looks like
```python 
def __init__(self):
    # no body, does nothing.
```
