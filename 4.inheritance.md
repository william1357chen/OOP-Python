# Inheritance in Python 
```python
class Employee:

    raise_amount = 1.04 # This is a class instance

    def __init__(self, first, last, pay):
        self.first = first
        self.last = last
        self.email = first + '.' + last + '@email.com'
        self.pay = pay

    def fullname(self):
        return '{} {}'.format(self.first, self.last)
    # Here we use self.raise_amount
    def apply_raise(self):
        self.pay = int(self.pay * self.raise_amount)
```
Let `Employee` be the base class and create `Developer` and `Manager` as a derived class to inherit the functionality of `Employee`

```python 
class Developer(Employee):
    pass

dev = Developer('william', 'chen', 10000)
```
The code above works since class `Developer` has all the functionalities of the `Employee` class. `Developer('william', 'chen', 10000)` prompts python to search for the constructor. Since it does not find it in the `Developer` class, it searches up chain of inheritance until it finds the desired constructor. This chain is called the `method resolution order`. You can use `help(Developer)` to see this chain

---
If we do 
```python 
class Developer(Employee):
    raise_amt = 1.10

dev.apply_raise()
print(dev.pay)

# Output 
# 55000
```
Remember, Developer isntances will search for instance variables in it's own class first, then class variables, then base class variables. This protects the base class from getting messed up by the derived class.

## Making a Constructor for Derived Class
If we want to initilize a `Developer` and store the programming language he/she knows as an attribute, we need a new contructor. Note that the constructor for `Emplyee` can handle the initilization of any parameters previously defined (in this case, first last and pay).
```python 
class Developer(Employee):
    raise_amt = 1.10

    def __init__(self, first, last, pay, prog_lang):
            super().__init__(first, last, pay) # let superclass handle first last and pay
            self.prog_lang = prog_lang

dev = Developer('william', 'chen', 10000, 'Java')
```

## Additional Information 
The function 
```python 
isinstance(object, class)
```
Returns a boolean value telling you whether that `object` is an instance of that `class`. 

```python
print(isinstance(dev, Developer))
print(isinstance(dev, Employee)) # dev is also an instance of Employee

# Output 
# True 
# True
```

The function
```python 
issubclass(class1, class2)
```
Returns a boolean value telling you whether class1 is a subclass of class2.
```python 
print(issubclass(Developer, Developer))
print(issubclass(Developer, Employee))

# Output 
# True 
# True
```
