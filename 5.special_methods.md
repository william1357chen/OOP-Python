# Special Methods or Operator Overloading

## Dunder Methods (Dunder means double underscore)

## The difference between __repr__ and __str__
`repr()` should be an unambiguous representation of the object, used for debugging and logging, meant for other programmers.

`str()` should be a readable representation of and object, meant to be displayed to the end-user

Note that `__repr__` can work as a backup for `__str__`. When there are no `__str__` special method, `str()` calls the `__repr__` method. We should at least implement `__repr__`. Usually, `__repr__` will return something we can use to recreate the object.

Let's return to the Employee class
```python
class Employee:

    raise_amount = 1.04 # This is a class instance

    def __init__(self, first, last, pay):
        self.first = first
        self.last = last
        self.email = first + '.' + last + '@email.com'
        self.pay = pay

    def fullname(self):
        return '{} {}'.format(self.first, self.last)
    # Here we use self.raise_amount
    def apply_raise(self):
        self.pay = int(self.pay * self.raise_amount)
```
We want `__repr__` to return something we can use to recreate the object

```python

class Employee:
    ...

    def __repr__(self):
        return "Employee('{}', '{}', {})".format(self.first, self.last, self.pay)

emp1 = Employee('William', 'Chen', 50000)
print(emp1)

# Output
# Employee('William', 'Chen', 50000)
```
Now if we want to recreate the object we can just copy the output
