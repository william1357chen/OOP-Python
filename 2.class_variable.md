# Class Variables 

## Instance Variables 
Instance variables are a class object's attributes. In the code block below, attributes in the `__init__` method are instance variables

```python 
class Employee:

    def __init__(self, first, last, pay):
        self.first = first
        self.last = last
        self.email = first + '.' + last + '@email.com'
        self.pay = pay

    def fullname(self):
        return '{} {}'.format(self.first, self.last)
```

## Class Variables
If you want a value that applies to every instance created, you make a class variable. In this example, every employee should get the same 4% raise.
```python
class Employee:

    raise_amount = 1.04 # This is a class instance

    def __init__(self, first, last, pay):
        self.first = first
        self.last = last
        self.email = first + '.' + last + '@email.com'
        self.pay = pay

    def fullname(self):
        return '{} {}'.format(self.first, self.last)
    # Here we use self.raise_amount
    def apply_raise(self):
        self.pay = int(self.pay * self.raise_amount)
```

This instance applies to every `Employee` object.
## Three ways to access a class instance
```python
emp1 = Employee("William", "Chen", 50000)
print(emp1.raise_amount)
print(Employee.raise_amount)
# Output
# 1.04
# 1.04
```
Both of these works. `emp1.raise_amount` is accessing the class instance with an object, and `Employee.raise_amount` is accessing it with the class. 

For `emp1.raise_amount`, the object checks **instance namespace** first, then checks the **class namespace**, then checks the **inherit class namespace**. 
### Important: Instance Namespace >> Class Namespace >> Inherit Namespace

### How to Check NameSpace
```python 
Employee.__dict__
emp1.__dict__
```


When you do 
```python 
emp1.raise_amount = 1.05
print(emp1.raise_amount)
print(Employee.raise_amount)

# Output
# 1.05
# 1.04
```
The emp1 does not actually change the class instance, it simply makes a new attribute called `self.raise_amount` and set that to `1.05`, and that overrides the class instance `Employee.raise_amount`. This is helpful since we can deal with exceptions like when a special employee gets a better raise. 

Note that in the method `apply_raise()` we use `self.raise_amount` other than `Employee.raise_amount` because we want instance objects to override class instances when needed. Using `Employee.raise_amount`, you specified that you want a class instance now and this will not work
```python 
class Employee:
    ...
    def apply_raise(self):
        self.pay = int(self.pay * Employee.raise_amount)

emp1 = Employee("William", "Chen", 50000)
# we want to make an exception
emp1.raise_amount = 2
emp1.apply_raise()
print(emp1.pay)
# Output - exception did not work
# 52000
```
