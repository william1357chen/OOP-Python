# Property Decorators

Let's take a look at a problem
```python
class Employee:

    raise_amount = 1.04 

    def __init__(self, first, last):
        self.first = first
        self.last = last
        self.email = self.first + '.' + self.last + '@email.com'

    def fullname(self):
        return '{} {}'.format(self.first, self.last)

emp1 = Employee('William', 'Chen')
emp1.first = 'Jim'
print(emp1.first)
print(emp1.email)
print(emp1.fullname())
```
### Output
```python 
Jim
William.Chen@email.com
Jim Chen
```
The attribute `self.email` is only defined once during intialization, and does not change when `self.first` is changed. We can fix this by making email a method that takes in `self.first` and `self.last`. 

```python
def email(self):
        return '{} {}@email.com'.format(self.first, self.last)

print(emp1.email())
```

However, what if we want to access email as then an attribute?

### Use a property decorator and make a Getter method
We define email as a method but we can access it as an attribute
```python
@property
def email(self):
        return '{} {}@email.com'.format(self.first, self.last)
print(emp1.email)
```

Let's also change `fullname()` method to an attribute
```python
@property
def fullname(self):
        return '{} {}'.format(self.first, self.last)
```

## Setter Method
Let's say now we want to do 
```python
emp1.fullname = "Corey Schafer"
```
And we want this to change `self.first' and  `self.last`

The way to make a setter function is with `@methodname.setter` decorator

```python
@property
def fullname(self):
        return '{} {}'.format(self.first, self.last)

@fullname.setter
def fullname(self, name):
    first, last = name.split()
    self.first = first
    self.last = last

emp1.fullname = 'Corey Schafer' # Now this works
```

## Deleter Method
If we want to run some cleanup code, like deleting the fullname of an Employee, we use the `@methodname.deleter` decorator.
```python 
@fullname.deleter
def fullname(self):
    print('Delete Name')
    self.first = None
    self.last = None

del emp_1.fullname # This calls the deleter
```

### Note that only getter attributes can have setters. 

# Final Code 
```python 
class Employee:

    raise_amount = 1.04 

    def __init__(self, first, last):
        self.first = first
        self.last = last

    @property
    def email(self):
            return '{} {}@email.com'.format(self.first, self.last)
    print(emp1.email)

    @property
    def fullname(self):
            return '{} {}'.format(self.first, self.last)

    @fullname.setter
    def fullname(self, name):
        first, last = name.split()
        self.first = first
        self.last = last

    @fullname.deleter
    def fullname(self):
        print('Delete Name')
        self.first = None
        self.last = None
```
