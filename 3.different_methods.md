# Regular Methods vs Class Methods vs Static Methods

## Regular Methods
By convention, takes `self` as the first parameter

## Class Methods 
Add `@classmethod` decorator, and by convention take `cls` as first parameter. We now receive the class as our argument, rather than the class instance.
```python
class Employee:

    raise_amount = 1.04 
    def __init__(self, first, last, pay):
        self.first = first
        self.last = last
        self.email = first + '.' + last + '@email.com'
        self.pay = pay

    def fullname(self):
        return '{} {}'.format(self.first, self.last)
    # Here we use self.raise_amount
    def apply_raise(self):
        self.pay = int(self.pay * self.raise_amount)
    
    @classmethod
    def set_raise_amt(cls, amount):
        cls.raise_amount = amount
```
Now we are working with the class in the `set_raise_amt()` method.
```python 
Employee.set_raise_amt(2)
print(emp1.raise_amount)
print(Employee.raise_amount)

# Output 
# 2
# 2
```

Note that we can run **class methods** with instances as well, but that is bad practice.
```python 
emp_1.set_raise_amt(1.05)
print(emp1.raise_amount)
print(Employee.raise_amount)

# Output 
# 1.05
# 1.05
```
### We can use class methods to make multiple constructors 
Let's say employee info are in a single string, and we want to create an instance from just that one string.
```python 
emp_str_1 = 'John-Doe-70000'
```
Create an alternate constructor. Note that by convention, alternate constructors start with the word `from`
```python 
@classmethod 
def from_string(cls, emp_str):
    first, last, pay = emp_str.split('-')
    return cls(first, last, pay)
```
We can make `Employee` instances from this function 
```python 
emp_str_1 = 'John-Doe-70000'
new_emp_1 = Employee.from_string(emp_str_1)
```

## Static Methods
Passes neither `self` or `cls`. Works like a normal function, and simply in the class because they have some logical connection with the class.

Let's say we want to create a function that returns whether today is a workday. It does not depend on class or instance variables but it is relevant to the class.
```python 
@staticmethod 
def is_workday(day):
    return day.weekday() == 5 or day.week() == 6

```
### When should a method be static
When you do not access any class or instance variables.
